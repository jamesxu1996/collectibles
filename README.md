- **Target audience**
The target audience for the Collectibles marketplace application are people who do not want to use a general marketplace such as Amazon or eBay and want to facilitate transactions over a more niche marketbase. Anything from rare cards, watches, cameras, antiques; buyers and sellers will be able to transact and discover items that they enjoy collecting rather than a mass-consumer marketplace where there things are sold in large quantities or where rarer objects are not normally posted. This also makes it easier on the buyer to find rare items to buy or the seller to find buyers for their niche items.

**Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project**
Tasks for the project were managed and allocated using Trello. The board was set up in 3 sections: To do, In Progress and Completed. As tasks were being completed, they would be placed in the in progess column and when completed would be moved to the completed column. Checklists were used in each card to tick off as the task was being done; this segments the tasks even further and breaks down a large undertaking (creating the collectibles app) into more manageable bite sized pieces.
